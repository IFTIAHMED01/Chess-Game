# Creating Chess-game using java 
# INTRODUCTION:
The aim of this project is to provide the user a functional command line chess game supporting human vs human as well as human vs AI component. We have chosen to program this game in JAVA. We have not used any existing libraries and have implement the game completely from scratch. Our code comprises a main class which is the initial class connecting both AI and human vs human. We have separate classes for individual pieces defining their legal moves and applying constraints. In the player/AI class we connected all the individual classes are created a user-friendly board.
# USAGE GUIDELINES:
The user has many options in a real chess game, and we have implemented the same. When the game begins, the user can choose to play a multiplayer game or with an AI.</br>

When it is players turn, they are first presented with a menu to choose which piece to move. We have additionally included a user guide here which they can reference as well for instructions. One the player selects a piece they are prompted to choose the steps and direction of movement.</br>

For certain pieces like king which have a fixed limit a higher input of steps will not be recognized. For pieces with multiple options, they can choose further which one to move.</br>
We have also incorporated special move such as Castling and en-passant which are available to the user.</br>
